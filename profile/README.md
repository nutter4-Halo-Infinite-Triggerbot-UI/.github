# 🔫 Halo Infinite Triggerbot UI – Auto-Fire with Spartan Precision

## 🎮 Aim. Lock. Fire. No Button Press Needed.

Halo Infinite is all about split-second gunfights — but what if your weapon fired **automatically** the moment your crosshair lined up on a target? Enter the **Halo Infinite triggerbot UI**, a cheat designed to take the shot for you *instantly* with laser-sharp reaction time.

Forget about pulling the trigger. This tool detects when you're aiming directly at an enemy and fires for you — perfect for close quarters, high-speed matches, and sweaty gunfights where milliseconds matter.

And with a **clean, in-game UI**, you’re not just turning it on and hoping for the best. You get full control over every aspect of its behavior.
